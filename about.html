He received his B.A. in Classical Studies from Brigham Young University (2019, <i>cum laude</i>) and his M.Phil. in Classics, specializing in Ancient Philosophy, from the University of Cambridge (2020, pass with distinction).

By the fourth century, many Christian writers were attempting to integrate philosophical concepts into their theological and moral systems in order to showcase Christianity as an intellectual religious movement. This effort results in some fascinating treatises that must carefully balance the doctrines from scripture with non-Christian philosophy. In this vein, Zakarias has written about the use of the moral concept <i>propatheia </i>(inherited from the Stoic tradition) in Didymus the Blind’s <i>Commentary on the Psalms</i> and the consequences for Didymus’ Christology, and on Gregory of Nyssa who similarly imports philosophical terminology and concepts from Aristotle’s metaphysical treatises and Porphyry’s <i>Isagoge</i> in his treatise <i>Ad Ablabium</i>.</p><p>Zak's dissertation project will compare specific Neoplatonic commentaries with patristic scriptural commentaries. Other projects include the development of negative theology, from middle Platonism to the Neoplatonic and patristic theologies of the fifth and sixth centuries; ancient women philosophers; and the integration of Porphyry's <i>Isagoge </i>into Christian writings. Other interests include papyrology, digital humanities, Coptic, and Roman declamation.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 1, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://zdg5.github.io/academic-site/digital-projects.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Digital Projects </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://zdg5.github.io/academic-site/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://zdg5.github.io/academic-site/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://zdg5.github.io/academic-site/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
